        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p class="mb-3">Iâ€™m a product-minded software engineer and am a team lead within Patient Catalyst, a product by PA Consulting, where we are building a patient tracking tool for the NHS that services over 2 million patient pathways each day. </p>
        <p class="mb-3">My background is a mix between data engineering and backend. I currently build the data pipeline as well as coordinating the dev, product and implementation teams at Patient Catalyst. Before Patient Catalyst, I have experience in the consulting side of things where I worked across embedded and ML projects, across the life science and consumer industries. </p>
        <p class="mb-3">I see myself as a product engineer. That means that I want to build things that people like and want to use, not just things that work well. </p>
