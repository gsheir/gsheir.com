        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h2>In tech</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">I’m a product-minded software engineer and am a team lead within Patient Catalyst, a product by PA Consulting, where we are building a patient tracking tool for the NHS that services over 2 million patient pathways each day. </p>
        <p class="mb-3">My background is a mix between data engineering and backend. I currently build the data pipeline as well as coordinating the dev, product and implementation teams at Patient Catalyst. Before Patient Catalyst, I have experience in the consulting side of things where I worked across embedded and ML projects, across the life science and consumer industries. </p>
        <h2>In sports</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">Alongside my playing of hockey, I am an England Hockey Level 2 coach and have most recently coached our Women’s 6s and 7s at Cambridge City Hockey Club, who both achieved top 3 finishes. </p>
