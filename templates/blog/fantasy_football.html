                (For the purposes of discussion, I‚Äôll use ‚ÄúAI‚Äù to refer
                to LLM-enabled tools where the training and building of
                the model has been outsourced, otherwise we get into a
                deep, deep rabbit hole)

            How I ended up building
            <a href="http://gsheir.com">gsheir.com</a> using AI-assisted
            coding
        </h2>
        <p>
            I‚Äôm not the most evangelical of AI users ‚Äì I use GitHub
            Copilot (mainly as a very good autocompletion tool), but
            haven‚Äôt felt the need to use AI much beyond that. I‚Äôve
            always felt that a product should be built on technology and
            not be defined by it, so having not really been hooked by
            the value proposition of AI coding tools, I do recoil a bit
            when I hear about how
            <a href="https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer"
                >AI will make software engineering obsolete</a
            >
            (ew), and have watched the progress in AI with a bit of
            muted scepticism.
        </p>
        <p>
            So when I met a couple of friends for drinks last week and
            we floated the idea of building our own version of fantasy
            football for the Women‚Äôs Euros 2025, I broke rank with
            myself by suggesting I would try and vibe code something up.
            The time constraint (the tournament was starting in 3 days)
            and my limited web development experience meant that this
            was the perfect use case for some sort of agentic AI, vibe
            coding approach, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            This is what I learnt, and maybe what has changed about how
            I think about AI-assisted coding.
        </p>
        <h2>
            It‚Äôs kind of equivalent to getting up to speed with an
            existing codebase
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you stripped away the fact that the whole thing is
            written by a machine, it‚Äôs actually the same sort of process
            as any other technical onboarding. I was a bit overwhelmed
            at first, especially as I watched Copilot spit out code like
            there‚Äôs no tomorrow, but then I started interacting with the
            code and seeing how it did and didn‚Äôt work, then I read and
            understood the changes as they were made, and slowly I
            gained enough familiarity to try things myself and build on
            top of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            It‚Äôs pretty tempting to get Copilot to fix any problems that
            come up. I went through several cycles of seeing something
            that wasn‚Äôt working (e.g. not being able to run in Docker),
            finding out just enough information to know where the
            problem was, and then asking Copilot to fix it. It‚Äôs okay as
            a crutch while getting up to speed, but I think it‚Äôs a bit
            like always letting someone else drive during pair
            programming ‚Äì at some point you‚Äôll need to actually write
            something to get it exactly how you want it.
        </p>
        <h2>
            It won‚Äôt know what it can‚Äôt see (but it saw more than I
            thought)
        </h2>
        <p>
            This seems obvious, but the context window is hugely
            important, and the code that Copilot suggests won‚Äôt be that
            accurate if there are external dependencies, like
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>External API calls</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                External tools and environments (e.g. it didn‚Äôt really
                give decent answers to ‚Äúwhy is my Railway deployment
                configuration not working‚Äù)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I was pretty surprised to see it have much more control over
            things that I would traditionally think are outside its
            control, particularly around using the command line to check
            if a change is working, e.g. using <code>psql</code> to
            check database tables or checking the logs of Docker
            containers.
        </p>
        <p>
            It‚Äôs the sort of thing I would do as a dev if I wanted to
            check if something was working, and I can imagine Copilot
            eventually doing other things that an engineer would
            typically do, like doing exploratory data analysis using a
            Jupyter Notebook or reading API docs.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Finding the delegation boundary is key, and it‚Äôs different
            for everyone
        </h2>
        <p>
            I think there‚Äôs a level of comfort that each person will
            have with how much they <em>let AI rip</em>. As a software
            engineer, where my primary output is the software I build, I
            do feel like retaining a degree of control, and really
            checking what‚Äôs being written by Copilot.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are loads of (slightly schadenfreude-inducing) stories
            about cost spikes and security vulnerabilities introduced by
            a failure to review AI-suggested code properly. I‚Äôve found
            that when Copilot was given free rein, there was
            particularly risky territory that I was at risk of entering,
            especially around
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Ensuring AI-written tests to make sure the intent is
                clear and the feature actually functions, even if the
                tests are passing
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc">
                Not committing things one shouldn‚Äôt
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The volume of code is also one to keep an eye on here, and I
            found that as Copilot tried different solutions, it left
            behind traces of its past work (e.g. redundant deployment
            scripts), so there‚Äôs a fair bit of cleaning up to do to make
            sure that the intent of the code is clear for the sake of
            maintainability.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Conclusion ‚Äì it‚Äôs actually not bad and I think I‚Äôll use it
            more, if there is value to doing so
        </h2>
        <p>
            Honestly, I don‚Äôt think I would have been able to build this
            app in the time that I did without AI, and I‚Äôm all for it
            for this use case. If you have a fun idea in mind but feel
            like you don‚Äôt necessarily have enough deep technical
            knowledge, it‚Äôs a good way to get started and gives you a
            lot of material to start learning from.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think I‚Äôm still some way away from using AI to this extent
            at work though, where the stakes are higher and I can do a
            lot of it unassisted, hence why I don‚Äôt see a massive
            paradigm shift anytime soon. I do think that it has improved
            loads since I‚Äôve first used it and it will get better in the
            future.

            Side notes and tidbits
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I‚Äôve not done many coding side projects in my own time
                before, so this was a cool experience in itself. I think
                the thing was that we as a friend group had already
                committed to playing the fantasy football game for the
                Euros, which forced me to actually build something for a
                deadline. Yes, it‚Äôs not perfect, and the API integration
                with the football data doesn‚Äôt work as well as I‚Äôd like,
                and there are many things I still want to improve about
                the gameplay (maybe in time for the WSL season in
                September). But it‚Äôs live, it‚Äôs running, I‚Äôm losing
                (sad), and I‚Äôve got a product and some users. I might
                only have two users, but they‚Äôre
                <em><strong>my</strong></em
                ><em> </em>users.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I‚Äôm kind of amazed at how easy it is to deploy and host
                something nowadays ‚Äì I went for
                <a
                    href="https://railway.com"
                    >Railway</a
                >, but the options are endless. For the cost of a pint
                every month, I don‚Äôt really have to worry about
                infrastructure (for the small scale of my app), and the
                CI experience is pretty seamless. Would recommend.

            <li>
                If you want to play the game or even to just click
                around, head to the top right and create an account,
                then join a league with the code 53HVBG. I want more
                users.
